The EXIT_VALUE constant is returned by the user when they utilize the menu to exit the application.
Since no one will be using the absolute minimum value that an integer in C++ can have, this constant contains the INT_MIN value.
This guarantees that the terminal is hardcoded to report results only in the event that the value does not equal EXIT_VALUE.
Since the example instructed us to just terminate the program without producing any output, I didn't return an error or any other kind.
